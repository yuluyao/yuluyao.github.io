>>> Foundation框架的`NSString`继承了Swift中的`String`

# String字面量
单行与多行String：
```swift
let singleLineString = "These are the same."
let multilineString = """
These are the same.
"""
```

多行String中嵌套的String，换行使用反斜杠`\`：
```swift
let softWrappedQuotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, \
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on \
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

多行String中，首行前面的空格会被忽略，并且后面每一行都会忽略同样数量的空格：

```swift
let softWrappedQuotation = """
    The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, \
      please your Majesty?" he asked.

    "Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on \
    till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```
显示效果：
```
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, \
  please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on \
till you come to the end; then stop."
```

String中的转义字符示例：
```swift
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
// "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
let dollarSign = "\u{24}"        // $,  Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"      // ♥,  Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}" // 💖, Unicode scalar U+1F496
```

**todo: Extended String Delimiters**

初始化空字符串：
```swift
var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initializer syntax
// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other
```

用`var`声明的String是可变的，用`let`声明的String不可变：
```swift
var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified
```

使用`for...in`循环遍历String：
```swift
for character in "Dog!🐶" {
    print(character)
}
// D
// o
// g
// !
// 🐶
```

在字符串中插入变量：
```swift
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
// message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"
```
